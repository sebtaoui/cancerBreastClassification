**Breast Cancer Classification - Brief Overview**  


Breast cancer classification is a machine learning (ML) or deep learning task that aims to categorize breast tumors as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using medical imaging (e.g., mammograms) or clinical data (e.g., biopsy results).

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps in Breast Cancer Classification
Data Collection â€“ Common datasets include:

Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) â€“ Contains clinical features like tumor size.
BreakHis, MIAS, or DDSM â€“ Contain mammogram images.
Preprocessing â€“ Includes data cleaning, normalization, feature selection, and image augmentation (for deep learning models).

Model Selection â€“

Traditional ML: SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression (for tabular data).
Deep Learning: CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG16) for image-based classification.
Training & Evaluation â€“ Models are trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction & Deployment â€“ Once trained, the model can classify new breast cancer cases for early diagnosis.
